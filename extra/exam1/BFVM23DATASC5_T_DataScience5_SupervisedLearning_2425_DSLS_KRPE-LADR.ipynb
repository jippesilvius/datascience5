    "Take a minute to read the following instructions and information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "On BlackBoard you will find a zip-file containing the following materials:\n",
    "\n",
    "* this exam `BFVM23DATASC5_T_DataScience5_SupervisedLearning_2425_DSLS_KRPE-LADR.ipynb` (also as `*.pdf`);\n",
    "* data files `nhefs.pkl` and `nhefs_codebook.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an \"open-book\" exam that you take on school workstations using your own account. You are allowed to use any digital materials in your home folder, look up information on the internet, as well as consult any written materials. However, you are **not** allowed to utilize your own devices (e.g. telephone or laptop) or use communication media or AI-tools (e.g. chat and ChatGPT); this will be considered fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to leave the exam room for toilet or coffee breaks, except during the first and last hour of the scheduled exam time. You are not permitted to confer with fellow students about code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam consists of the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **<a href=\"#1\">Part I</a>**: Missing data imputation <small>[20 pts]</small>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **<a href=\"#2\">Part II</a>**: Feature importance <small>[20 pts]</small>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **<a href=\"#3\">Part III</a>**: A decision tree variant <small>[20 pts]</small>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **<a href=\"#4\">Part IV</a>**: Optimized predictive pipeline <small>[30 pts]</small>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each part directs you to perform a particular supervised-machine learning analysis. If you do not understand what is meant, you may ask the exam's supervisor for clarification. Execute the analysis that is requested. Use your own judgement to perform any steps that you deem necessary, even if those are not all explicitly requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The various parts have a logical order, but can be answered separately; therefore, you can always continue to a next part. If you are unable to (fully) solve one part, an explanation of your intended solution in the form of text or pseudo-code may be awarded partial credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Do not only provide code solutions, but explain by means of comments and/or text markup why you perform steps, as well as what you conclude from the output of an analysis!\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Save your notebook regularly to avoid inadvertent loss of your progress! Instructions on how to submit your answers after you finish are provided at the very <a href=\"#X\">bottom</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "All parts have the possible number of points to be scored indicated. Your grade will be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Grade} = 1 + 9 \\cdot \\frac {\\text{Points Scored}} {\\text{Maximum Score}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* 50 % of your grade is based on the insightfulness of provided explanations, motivations, interpretations, and conclusions drawn from your analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 50 % of your grade is based on the correctness, completeness, efficiency, and intelligibility of the code(*) that you produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "*: If you only make use of standard `sklearn` regressor/classifier classes, the maximum final grade is an 8; if you also use your own classes developed during the course, the maximum grade is a 10.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will be working with a dataset from the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Nhefs/Default.aspx) (NHEFS) longitudinal cohort study that was jointly initiated by the National Center for Health Statistics and the National Institute on Aging in collaboration with other agencies of the Public Health Service in the USA. The NHEFS was designed to investigate the relationships between clinical, nutritional, and behavioral factors and subsequent morbidity, mortality, and hospital utilization, as well as changes in risk factors, functional limitation, and institutionalization. Thousands of people were followed and measurements were performed for several decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present dataset and codebook comprises a selection of these data that are available [online](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/causaldata/nhefs.html). Moderate preprocessing was performed, dropping some features of minor interest, recoding some values, and dropping a small number of instances with too many missing values. All data were saved in a dataframe, with each column being of either a numeric (`float64`) or categorical (`category`) data type.\n",

One basic method is to rank features on for instance their correlation with the mortality outcome, or perform statistical tests to evaluate the significance of differences between surviving and deceased participants. However, this approach only assesses one feature at a time and is unable to capture additive or interacting effects that involve multiple features. In contrast, machine learning models can deal with many features at a time. However, not all machine learning models give rise to a model that allows straightforward interpretation of which features play an important role.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Train your chosen model to predict the mortality (i.e. the `death` feature) from all other features. Insofar as your chosen model has any settings or hyperparameters that you can vary, perform some optimization to arrive at an \"optimal\" model.

    "## Part III: A decision tree variant <small>[20 pts]</small>\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, decision trees make use of a cost function criterion to greedily split up instances according to some feature in each node. These criteria are derived from the distribution of class labels, described by probabilities $p_c$ (where $c$ indicates the various possible classes). The aim is to determine which split is able to *minimize* the averaged value of the criterion over the branches that leave the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common criterion in use is the [Shannon information entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) $H$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = \\sum_c -p_c \\lg \\left( p_c \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another well-known criterion that `sklearn` provides by default is the [Gini impurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity) $I$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I = 1 - \\sum_c p_c^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Below three other uncommon criteria are listed. Only one of these is potentially suitable for use as a cost function to minimize during the construction of a decision tree. Which one is this? Motivate your answer by explaining what desirable property it has that the others do not have.\n",
    "\n",
    "  a. $A = 1 - \\max_c \\left\\{ p_c \\right\\}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  b. $B = \\sum_c p_c$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  c. $C = \\sum_c \\lg \\left( \\frac{1}{p_c} \\right)$\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Implement your above chosen criterion in the form of a classifier that is compatible for use with `sklearn`. That is, it should be a class that can be trained (`fit(self, X, y)`) and applied (`predict(self, X)`; `predict_proba(self, X)`). Use recursion to build sub-branches of the tree. For extra credit, implement regularization hyperparameters like `max_depth` or `min_samples_split` (see the `sklearn` documentation). You may use the decision tree classifier that you constructed during class as a template. Either create a module that you import, or define the class in a notebook code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply your decision tree model to predict the mortality (i.e. the `death` feature) based on the other available features, and compare its performance to similar types of `DecisionTreeClassifier` that `sklearn` provides with criterion `'entropy'` or `'gini'`. (You are not required to perform cross-validation here; i.e. you may resubstitute the training data as test data.)"
