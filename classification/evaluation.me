Evaluation:

* BernoulliNaiveBayes classifier: Is used for datasets that are binary or boolean, so when there are only 2 options. The classifier performs well on small datasets and is efficient to use for text data. It is not performing well on multi-class data.
* GaussianNaiveBayes classifier: Is used when the features are normally distributed for each class and the dataset is numerical. It assumes that every features is independent so highly correlated features are detrimental to the performance of the classifier.
* ID3 classifier: Works only with categorical features and his main focus is information gain. Is good for small datasets since larger datasets are more complex and make it slow or the chance of overfitting is higher.
